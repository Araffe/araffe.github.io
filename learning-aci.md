This is a series of blog posts I wrote a few years back whilst working on the Application Centric Infrastructure solution at Cisco. **I no longer work at Cisco and won’t be updating these posts**; however, I’m keeping them here as they may still be useful for people starting out with ACI.

Here is a consolidated  list of blog entries in the Learning ACI series:

[Part 1:](https://araffe.github.io/aci/nexus%209000/2014/12/03/learning-aci-part-1-overview) Overview – Provides a very high level overview of ACI and what to expect from the blog series

[Part 2](https://araffe.github.io/aci/nexus%209000/2014/12/03/learning-aci-part-2-bringing-up-a-fabric): Bringing Up An ACI Fabric – Part 2 takes you through bringing up an ACI fabric for the first time, provisioning an APIC cluster and discovering the leaf and spine switching nodes in your network.

[Part 3](https://araffe.github.io/aci/nexus%209000/2014/12/03/learning-aci-part-3-getting-familiar-with-the-apic): Getting Familiar with the APIC – In this part, I take you through a tour of the APIC GUI, explaining what functionality is found under the main tabs.

[Part 4](https://araffe.github.io/aci/nexus%209000/2015/01/02/learning-aci-part-4-application-profiles-epgs-contracts-and-filters): Application Profiles, EPGs, Contracts and Filters – In part 4, we discuss some of the most important policy constructs on the fabric and how they are used to define application requirements.

[Part 5](https://araffe.github.io/aci/nexus%209000/2015/01/06/learning-aci-part-5-private-networks-bridge-domains-and-subnets): Private Networks, Bridge Domains and Subnets – Part 5 discusses the main networking policies and constructs within ACI and how they relate to each other.

[Part 6](https://araffe.github.io/aci/nexus%209000/2015/01/16/learning-aci-part-6-access-policies): Access Policies – In part 6, we walk through the process of creating an access policy to be used for bare metal host connectivity into the fabric.

[Part 7](https://araffe.github.io/aci/nexus%209000/2015/02/18/learning-aci-part-7-basic-connectivity): Basic Connectivity – In this installment, we discuss how to set up basic connectivity between two hosts across two EPGs.

[Part 8](https://araffe.github.io/aci/nexus%209000/2015/02/27/learning-aci-part-8-vmm-integration): VMM Integration – Part 8 discusses the integration between ACI and the virtual machine environment.

[Part 9](https://araffe.github.io/aci/nexus%209000/2015/03/29/learning-aci-part-9-layer-3-external-connectivity): Layer 3 External Connectivity – In this part, I explain how to configure routing from the ACI fabric to an external device.

[Part 10](https://araffe.github.io/aci/nexus%209000/sdn/2015/06/19/learning-aci-part-10-programming-the-aci-fabric): Programming the ACI Fabric – In this part, we’ll take a look at some of the programmability options available within ACI.

[Part 11](https://araffe.github.io/aci/nexus%209000/sdn/2015/10/18/learning-aci-part-11-transit-routing): Transit Routing – In this part, I’m discussing the transit routing capability of the ACI fabric that came in with the 1.1(1j) release.

[Part 12](https://araffe.github.io/nexus/nexus%209000/2016/12/16/learning-aci-part-12-inter-vrf-and-inter-tenant-communication): Inter VRF and Inter-Tenant Communication – In this latest post, I’m taking a look at how to configure inter-VRF and inter-tenant communication on the ACI fabric.
