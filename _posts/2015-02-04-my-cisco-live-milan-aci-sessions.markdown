Just a quick note to say that both my ACI sessions from Cisco Live Milan in January are available now for viewing online:

[BRKACI-2345 - ACI: What We Have Learnt From Early Deployments](https://www.ciscolive.com/online/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=81803&backBtn=true)

[BRKACI-1789 - How To Perform Common Tasks In ACI](https://www.ciscolive.com/online/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=81798&backBtn=true)

You'll need a login to access both the slides and the videos.

Enjoy!

Adam
